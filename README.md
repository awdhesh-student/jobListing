# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run the project locally, you need to unzip the folder downloaded from GitHub link
and install all the dependencies by running the command "npm install" on your editor

**NOTE**: the provided URL was not working, that`s why created a dummy data present as jobListings.json.
